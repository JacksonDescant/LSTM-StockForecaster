# PyTorch LSTM Stock Forecasting Model

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model designed for stock price forecasting. The LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly good at learning sequences, making it ideal for time series data like stock prices. This model is trained on the SPY 500 ETF and is what it predicts.

## Model Details

 - Model Type: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
 - Framework: PyTorch
 - Input Data: Historical stock closing prices from yfinance

## Prerequisites

Before running the model, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- yfinance (for historical market data)
- DeepCopy (to manipulate market data)
- sklearn (for preprocessing data)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (optional, for plotting results)
